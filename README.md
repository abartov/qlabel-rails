qlabel-rails
============

A Rails wrapper for the jQuery plugin qLabel by Denny Vrandecic (Google).

qLabel is a JavaScript library that helps you create multilingual websites.

qLabel looks for HTML elements that are annotated with an URI, a unique
identifier for the entity mentioned, uses the URI to look up the label
in the requested language, and then displays the label.
